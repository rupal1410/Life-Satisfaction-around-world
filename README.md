# Life-Satisfaction-around-world
The dataset I  am using here takes 7 parameters to measure the happiness index which is  referred to as Life Ladder or Ladder Score with 0 being the lowest and 10 being  the highest. The parameters are: Log GDP per capita, Freedom to make life  choices, social support, perceptions of corruption, healthy life expectancy at birth,  positive and negative affect. The data has been collected from year 2005 to 2021.  [1]. Through this project we are going to learn about happiness patterns  worldwide, based on the seven factors affecting happiness as mentioned. To get  interesting insights from the data, various methods and models are used including  data visualization using Graphs and charts, statistic modelling and regression  analysis, Hypothesis testing, correlation analysis etc
